1. Obtain a comprehensive RCT data (e.g. Head Start RCT)
2. Estimate effect size through traditional statistical means
3. Use effect size to determine DAG
4. Use the DAG on a large scale with observational dataset
5. Use causal DAG to predict effect

Side note -- Consider the clinical trial phases:
Phase I trials
Researchers test an experimental drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time. 
The researchers evaluate the treatment’s safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. 

Phase II trials
The experimental drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

Phase III trials
The experimental study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people. 
Researchers confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, 
and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely. 

Phase IV trials
Post-marketing studies, which are conducted after a treatment is approved for use by the FDA, 
provide additional information including the treatment or drug’s risks, benefits, and best use.
