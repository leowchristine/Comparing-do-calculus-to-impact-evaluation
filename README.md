# Comparing-do-calculus-to-impact-evaluation
This compares and contrasts the causal inference approach between do-calculus and impact evaluation

This is not about codes for conducting casual inference in do-calculus versus impact evaluation. We are not fully there yet. 
This is a place to consider how the two disciplines approach causality. What are the similarities and differences?

The approach to impact evaluation is taken from the Department of Education What Works Clearinghouse (WWC).
WWC is a well recongized resource on setting the standards for conducting causal studies in education.
