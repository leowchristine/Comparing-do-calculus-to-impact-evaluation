Graphical Analysis
4 types of graphs are needed:
1.	A graph plotting the probability of receiving treatment as a function of the forcing/rating variable 
(i.e. the variable on the x-axis that is used to determine the cut-off) – this is to determine if the design is sharp or fuzzy
2.	Graphs plotting the relationship between baseline variables (covariates or demographics variables) 
and the forcing variable – this is to determine if there is baseline equivalence between the treatment and comparison groups
3.	A frequency graph of the forcing variable – to determine if there is any manipulation of the forcing variable around the cut-off
4.	A graph plotting the relationship between the outcome variable on the y-axis and the forcing variable on the x-axis – 
this shows the impact of the treatment

To plot #4 graph, it has been suggested in the literature that a smoothed plot should be presented, meaning:
•	Divide the forcing variable into a number of equal sized intervals (i.e. bins). No bin should contain the cut-off point 
within its bandwidth
•	Determine the average value of the outcome variable and the mid-point value of each bin. Also count the number of observations 
in each bin
•	Plot the average outcome on the y-axis against the mid-point value of the forcing variable for each bin on the x-axis, 
weighted by the number of observations
•	To help visually, one can include flexible regression lines (such as lowess lines)

There are ways to determine the optimal bin width. See Jacob et al (2012) p. 12-16.

Determining the Correct Functional Form
Two strategies to consider:
1.	Parametric/Global Strategy
This is based on the whole sample of data

Determining a model that best fits the whole sample of data, starting from the simplest model. 
The graphical analysis could also shed light on an appropriate model.
Linear: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + εi
Linear interaction: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + β2riTi + εi
Quadratic: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + β2ri2 + εi
Quadratic interaction: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + β2ri2 + β3ri Ti + β4ri2 Ti + εi
Cubic: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + β2ri2 + β3ri3 + εi
Quadratic interaction: Yi = α + β0Ti + β1ri + β2ri2 + β3ri3 + β4riTi + β5ri2 Ti + β6ri3 Ti + εi

For more details on the types of statistical test to determine the best model, see Jacob et al (2012) p.23-28.

2.	Non-parametric/Local Strategy
This is based on a localized, subset of data around the cut-off
Two methods can be used for determining the appropriate model (and hence determining the point estimate) using the local strategy
i)	“leave-one-out” cross validation procedure – this procedure picks the bandwidth that minimizes the cross-validation criterion, 
that is, selecting the bin width that gives the smallest mean square error
ii)	The “plug-in” procedure – software program for it is available from 
the Imbens’ website http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/imbens/software_imbens

For both i) and ii), if the point estimates derived between different models 
(from linear, to linear interaction, to quadratic, to quadratic interaction) are quite similar, the simpler model is to be selected.

More details are found in Jacob et al (2012) p.31-38.

Between the global strategy and the local strategy, if the findings agree, great! 
If not, determine the discrepancy. If it is a matter of magnitude, choose the smaller magnitude to be conservative.

If sample size is small, the global strategy might be preferred over the local strategy, 
with the local strategy treated as complementary analysis, and vice versa with large samples.

Precision and Sample Size Requirements
According to Jacob et al (2012)
1.	Compared to a RCT, a RD design would need at least 2.4 times the sample size to get the same precise estimate of impact.
2.	When the estimation model gets more complex, it is at the expense of precision

Sharp versus Fuzzy RD Designs
Type II Fuzzy Design – when those assigned to the treatment did not receive the treatment (no-shows) 
and those assigned to comparison received the treatment (cross-overs).

Instead of estimating intent-to-treat (ITT), in a fuzzy design, we might be interested in the local average treatment effect (LATE)
– that is, the unbiased estimate on those assigned to the treatment group who actually received the treatment and 
those assigned to the comparison group and actually did not receive the treatment (i.e. compliers).

Use of instrumental variable two-stage least squares to estimate the impact:
First stage equation Ti = α1 + γ0Di + f1(ri) + εi
Second stage equation Yi = α + β0Ti + f2(ri) + μi

where Yi = outcome for individual i
 Ti = 1 if individual i receives the treatment and 0 otherwise
Di = 1 if individual i is assigned to treatment based on the cut-off and 0 otherwise
f1(ri) = the relationship between the rating and treatment receipt for individual i
f2(ri) = the relationship between the rating and outcome for individual i
