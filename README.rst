# Comparing-do-calculus-to-impact-evaluation

The goal here is to compare and contrast the causal inference approach between do-calculus and impact evaluation

This is not about codes for conducting casual inference in do-calculus versus impact evaluation. I do't think we are truly there to automate causal inference. 
This is a place to consider how the two disciplines approach causality. What are the similarities and differences?

The causal approach from the impact evaluation perspective is taken from:
The Department of Education What Works Clearinghouse (WWC). WWC is a well recognized authority on setting the standards for conducting causal studies in education (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/)

The causal approach from the do-claculus perspective is taken from various sources:
1. Microsoft's DoWhy (https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy#installation)
2. Bayesia's Bayesian Networks & BayesiaLab (https://www.bayesialab.com/)
